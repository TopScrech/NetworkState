## üíª Installation

```
https://github.com/rebeloper/NetworkState.git
```
### ‚úä Manual Installation
Download and include the `NetworkState` folder and files in your codebase.

### üì≤ Requirements
- iOS 13+
- Swift 5.3+

## üëâ Import

Import `NetworkState` into your `View`

```
import NetworkState
```

## üß≥ Features

Here's the list of the awesome features `NetworkState` has:
- [X] has a `@Published` `isOnline` variable to inspect
- [X] access it as an `@EnvironmentObject` throughout your app
- [X] easy to set up; easier to use

## üíª How to use

First create a `NetworkState` object and add it as an `environmentObject` to your root `View`.

```
import SwiftUI
import NetworkState

@main
struct NetworkStateDemoApp: App {
    
    // 1.
    let networkState = NetworkState()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            // 2.
            ContentView().environmentObject(networkState)
        }
    }
}
```

Grab that `EnvironmentObject` (1.) and use the `isOnline` `@Published` variable (2.) to render out your UI. Optionally you could refres/check the connectivity with `isConnected()`. 

```
import SwiftUI
import NetworkState

struct ContentView: View {
    
    // 1.
    @EnvironmentObject var networkState: NetworkState
    
    @State var isOnline = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 12) {
            // 2.
            if networkState.isOnline {
                Image(systemName: "wifi").font(.largeTitle)
            } else {
                Image(systemName: "wifi.slash").font(.largeTitle)
            }
            
            // or 
            // Image(systemName: networkState.isOnline ? "wifi" : "wifi.slash").font(.largeTitle)
            
            // 3.
            Button(action: {
                if let isConnected = networkState.isConnected(), isConnected {
                    isOnline = isConnected
                } else {
                    isOnline = false
                }
            }, label: {
                Text("Refresh manually")
            })
            
            if isOnline {
                Text("Showing this text only after we tapped the Button and if network is Connected")
            }
            
        }
    }
}
```
